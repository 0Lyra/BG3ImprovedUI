- Unlocks edit appearance option for all Origin characters in Character Creation.
- OPTIONAL Keyboard-only tweaks: Switched "Expand Tooltip" (highlighting all interactables, default left ALT key) from a toggle to a press. This gets disabled by pressing the key again, or switching to a different UI screen, such as the map or pause screen. (Credit: Violet-Vibes)
- OPTIONAL Keyboard-only tweaks: Hides the bottom-left buttons when in dialogue with companions and NPCs where Attack/Trade are not relevant. Can still be accessed by placing your mouse in the bottom-left area. This cleans up the UI when experiencing intimate scenes. (Credit: Wesslan)

#### Modder Features
- Character Creation Layout tweaks: Removes head scroll limit (Credit: Alana)
- Character Creation Layout tweaks: Removes appearance tab restrictions allowing for modded slot use (ex: Origin Hairstyles, Humans with tails)
- Character Creation Layout tweaks: Changes Dragonborn Sorcerer Draconic Ancestry to allow for additional scale types.
- Character Creation Layout tweaks: Allows for Feat selection once unlocked by another mod. Tip - "Allowimprovement" doesn't work on its own.
- OPTIONAL Supports modded class icons, with a generic icon given to mods without a provided icon
- OPTIONAL Supports modded action resources to appear in the action resource bar (instead of a red star placeholder)
