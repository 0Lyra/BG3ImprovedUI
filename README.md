- Unlocks edit appearance option for all Origin characters in Character Creation.
- Magic Mirror tweaks: Allows all combinations to hit confirm.
- <b>OPTIONAL FILE REQUIRED</b> Switches "Show all items" (highlighting all interactables, default left ALT key/right stick) from requiring a held input to an on/off switch. Works for both Keyboard and Controller - switching between the two input methods when enabled would cause an additional toggle to be required. Stays on UI change (such as game menu/dialogue) except when showing other tooltips. (Credit: Violet-Vibes)

<b>OPTIONAL FILE REQUIRED</b> Keyboard-only tweaks:
- Hides the bottom-left buttons when in dialogue with companions and NPCs where Attack/Trade are not relevant. Can still be accessed by placing your mouse in the bottom-left area. This cleans up the UI when experiencing intimate scenes. (Credit: Wesslan)
- Replaces existing Minimap with smaller version (75% zoom, takes up less space on screen) or no Minimap (leaving the relevant buttons).
