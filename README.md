- Character Creation Layout Tweaks: Removes head scroll limit (Credit: Alana)
- Supports modded class icons, with a generic icon given to mods without a provided icon
- Removes version text from Dialogue and in-game screens
- Supports modded action resources to appear in the action resource bar (instead of a red star placeholder)
- Allows for Feat selection in CC once someone has worked out how to give Feats at level 1

#### Installing 
EITHER: Use Candor/BG3 Mod Manager/Nexus to install, this would require [Patch3fixer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/550) or a mod that includes it to work correctly.

OR: Place the .pak in the folder "%LocalAppData%\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods" without using a mod manager/updating the modsettings.lsx file.
