- Removes unused "All Colours" tickbox from Makeup selection
- Supports modded class icons, with a generic icon given to mods without a provided icon
- Unhooks Deity selection from subclass to multiple classes, allows for additional classes to select Deity with additional mods
- Removes early access text from Dialogue and in-game screens

#### Installing 
EITHER: Use Candor/BG3 Mod Manager to install, this would require [Patch3fixer](https://nb-stor.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bg3/nrd_killstory.pak) or a mod that includes it to work correctly.

#### DISCLAIMER
- The main goal behind an Early Access is to provide meaningful feedback to the developers. To do so, Larian implemented an automatic telemetry that will provide data for them automatically as you play  
- Since modding BG3 is not yet officially supported by Larian Studios, you might encounter unexpected problems that it's not in their current scope to fix. **PLEASE DISABLE AUTOMATIC TELEMETRY** and don't post bug reports on their official platforms, as you're playing an unsupported mod
